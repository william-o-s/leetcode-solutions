# general lessons

- be certain about the correctness of the algorithm
- try to identify a pattern to solve it e.g. contiguous substring -> sliding window
- i explained this problem in 10min 30sec and coded it in 10min

# steps

1. understand the problem
2. clarify the input and output
3. find the solution
4. verify edge cases
5. walk through time complexity - it's ok to introduce new parameters other than N the length
